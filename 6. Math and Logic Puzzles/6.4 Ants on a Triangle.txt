Solution.
The ants will collide if any of them are moving towards each other.
So, the only way that they won't collide is if they are all moving in the same
direction (clockwise or counterclockwise).
We can compute this probability and work backwards from there.

Since each ant can move in two directions, and there are three ants,
the probability is:
    P(clockwise)= (1/2)³
    P(counter clockwise)= (1/2)³
    P(same direction)= (1/2)³ + (1/2)³ = 1/4

The probability of collision is therefore the probability of the ants not
moving in the same direction:
    P(collision) = 1 - P(same direction) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4

To generalize this to an n-vertex polygon:
there are still only two ways in which the ants can move to avoid a collision,
but there are 2ⁿ ways they can move in total.
Therefore, in general, probability of collision is:
    P(clockwise) = (1/2)ⁿ
    P(counter) = (1/2)ⁿ
    P(same direction) = 2(1/2)ⁿ = (1/2)ⁿ⁻¹
    P(collision) = 1 - P(same direction) = 1 - (1/2)ⁿ⁻¹
